Yo! I'm Yash,
I am a student(currently) and someday want to build a full OS by myself.(Might seem delusional but I have always been...)
I currently have java, C and C++ as my main languages with Mongodb (I mean writing SELF SUFFICIENT CODE with java as my DSA training language.)
I have also learnt Go trying to contribute to kubernetes and trying some *good first issues* and struggling along.
I also do penetration testing just for the fun (just wish finding vulnerabilities was as easy as in the 90s)
Learning along,
Thank You Linus Torvalds for github!
